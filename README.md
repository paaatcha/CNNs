# Convolutional neural network (CNN)

This repository has my own CNNs code implementation. Each folder is a different model for a different purpose. Feel free to use any of them.
As the datasets are too big, I dind't include them here.  

If you find some bug or have any comments, please email me.


Dependencies: 
* TensorFlow
* Keras
